## **FlattenArray Class Objective**

 The purpose of this class is to study the Ruby language,
  specifically by reproducing the native flatten method of Ruby.
  The goal is to explore different approaches to flattening arrays, that is,
  transforming an array with nested elements into a simple array containing only the values.

## **How To Test**

  To test the functionality of the FlattenArray class, you can run the test file flatten_spec.rb,
  which contains unit tests using RSpec.

  Alternatively, you can execute the class directly by instantiating an object of the FlattenArray
  class and calling the flatten_array method to verify the behavior of the implementation.

## **Running the Tests**

  execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
  bundle exec rspec spec/ruby/flatten_array_spec.rb
```
